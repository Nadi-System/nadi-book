# Who this book is for

<div class="warning">
If you are a developer and want an API documentation for the data types used in the NADI Rust library refer to the [docs.rs `nadi_core` page](https://docs.rs/nadi_core/latest/nadi_core/). But if you want to understand the core concepts, use cases, and examples then proceed.
</div>

This book has sections explaining the concepts of the NADI system, its developmental notes, user guide and developer guide.

Hence it can be useful for people who:
- Want to understand the concepts used in NADI,
- Want to use NADI system for their use case,
- Want to develop plugin system for NADI,
- Want to contribute to the NADI system packages, etc.

Although not intended, it might include resources and links to other materials related to Rust concepts, Geographical Information System (GIS) concepts, Hydrology concepts, etc. that people could potentially benefit from.

Please note that, this book assumes you have some knowledge of programming, like control flow, loops, functions, variables, etc. As as well some knowledge of GIS if you are reading network detection + GIS visualization specific functions. Those concepts will not be covered in this book. And if you are reading the developer reference or compiled plugin development, some knowledge of rust is assumed, but this is not necessary for the users of NADI that will only write code in NADI.
