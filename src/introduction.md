# Trivia
- Nadi means River in Nepali (and probably in many south asian languages).
- First prototype of NADI was Not Available Data Integration, as it
  was meant to be an algorithm to fill data gaps using network
  information, but it was modified to be more generic for many network
  related analysis.
