# Network Analysis and Data Integration (NADI)

NADI is group of software packages that facilitate network analysis and do data analysis on data related to network/nodes.



# Trivia
- Nadi means River in Nepali (and probably in many south asian languages).
- First prototype of NADI was Not Available Data Integration, as it
  was meant to be an algorithm to fill data gaps using network
  information, but it was modified to be more generic for many network
  related analysis.
