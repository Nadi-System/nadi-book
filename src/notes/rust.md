# Why Rust?

Rust[^fn1] is an open source programming language that claims to be fast and memory efficient to power performance critical services. Rust is also able to integrate with other programming languages.

Rust provides a memory safe way to do modern programming. The White
House has a recent press
release[^fn2]
about the need to have memory safe language in future softwares. The
report[^fn3]
has following sentense about the Rust language.

<div class="right">
At this time, the most widely used languages that meet all three
properties are C and C++, which are not memory safe programming
languages. Rust, one example of a memory safe programming language,
has the three requisite properties above, but has not yet been proven
in space systems.

The results of the survey from
stackoverflow[^fn4]
shows Rust has been a top choice for developers who want to use a new
technology for the past 8 years, and the analysis also shows Rust is a
language that generates for desire to use it once you get to know.
