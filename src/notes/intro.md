# Developer Notes

This section contains my notes as I develop the NADI system. Kind of
like a dev blog.

The software package will consists of multiple components. It is
planned to be designed in such a way that users can add their
functionality and extend it with ease.

Along with the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) principles, the
plugin system will make extension of the software functionality and
sharing between users. As well as a way to develop in-house
functionality for niche use cases.
