# Internal Plugins
There are some plugins that are provided with the `nadi_core`
library. They are part of the library, so users can directly use them.

For example in the following tasks file, the functions that are
highlighted are functions available from the core plugins. Other
functions need to be loaded from plugins.


```task
{{#include ../data/example.tasks}}
```
