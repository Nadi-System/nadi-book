If you need help on any functions. Use the `help` as a `task`. You can use `help.node` or `help.network` for specific help.

```task run
help.node render()
```

Or you can use `nadi --fnhelp <function>` using the `nadi-cli`.

Now that you have the overview of the nadi system's data
structures. We'll jump into the software structure and how to setup
and use the system.

If you want more details on any of the data structures refer the
Developer's references, or the library documentation.
