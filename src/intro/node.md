# Node

A Node is a point in network. A Node can have multiple input nodes and
only one output node. And a Node can also have multiple attributes
identifiable with their unique name, along with timeseries values also
identifiable with their names.

If you understand graph theory, then node in nadi network is the same
as a node in a graph.
