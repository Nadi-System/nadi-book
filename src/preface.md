# Preface

<div class="warning">
NADI is currently under active development. As such does not have stable API
yet, and many of the concepts explained in this book might not work
yet.

If you still want to use it for your projects, please do them with the
knowledge that the API might change in next versions, and you might
have to keep it updated until the system is stable. If you have any
problems with the program, or would like some new features, please
make an github issue, we will try to accomodate it if it fits within
the scope of the program.
