# Network Functions
Network functions are functions that take the network as a mutable
reference and run on it.


Some examples of network functions:
- List all the networks with their inputs/outputs,
- Checks if any nodes have some attribute larger than their output,
- Export the node attributes as a single CSV file,
- Export the nodes in LaTeX file using Tikz to draw the network,
- Calculate rmse,mse,etc errors between two attribute values for all nodes,
- Generate an interactive HTML/PDF with network information and some other template, etc.
