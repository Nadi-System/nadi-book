# Timeseries

Timeseries of values, at regular interval. Can support integers,
floats, booleans, strings, Arrays and Tables.

For timeseries that are not in a format that NADI can understand. The
path to the timeseries can be provided as a node attribute and plugin
functions can be written to use that path to load the timeseries for
the node.
